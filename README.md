# FStack Class of March 2024 Project
# MVP (Minimum Viable Project)

#Functioning as a tangible proof of concept, this Bash script facilitates the execution of diverse scans on user-specified targets, whether they are IP addresses or domain names. By adeptly capturing user input, encompassing vital details like target specifics, desired scan type, and duration, the script ensures a tailored scanning experience. The pivotal step of verifying tool availability, notably nmap, precedes the establishment of a dedicated output directory, streamlining the organization of scan results. Core functionality entails the seamless execution of selected scans, with resultant data securely cataloged within the predefined directory. Upon completion, users are promptly informed of the storage location, enhancing accessibility. This proof of concept lays a solid groundwork for potential future enhancements, encompassing expanded scan types and tools, refined error handling mechanisms, user interface enhancements, and the integration of advanced features like automated reporting or scheduling capabilities. Additional improvements will include warning prompts to prohibit illegal use and many other various ease of use and functionaltiy optimizations.
